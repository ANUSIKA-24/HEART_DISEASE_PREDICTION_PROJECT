# HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION_PROJECT
The heart disease prediction model predicts the risks of a patient being affected by any heart disease, to check any abnormalities in the patientâ€™s medical data.This prediction module uses a dataset that has data regarding the age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc of multiple patients.In this project, by implementing various machine learning algorithms, we are trying to figure out the most accurate algorithm for prediction.For data pre-processing we have imported the needed csv file, and have checked for any null values present, and then separated the dataset into training and testing data.
